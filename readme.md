Demonstrates the use of Binary coded decimal to decimal number conversion and vice-versa in a LASER based communication system. 
The sender enters a single binary digit into the serial monitor. This digit is converted to binary and sent as flashes of 
laser pulses at desired intervals.
The receiver detects the laser pulses using a LDR and converts the digit back to decimal and displays it on a 7-segment display.
Both the receiver and transmitter use an arduino UNO. The transmitter requires the use of a computer to enter the digit.
